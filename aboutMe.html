                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>Hi I'm Weijiang Li, aka Vicky.
                       I was born in Guangzhou, China and grew up there. 
                       Before high school, I was still following everone's path and 
                       didn't really think about where to go or what to do in the future.
                       However, I took a risk and decided to take SAT, Toefl, and APs instead of 
                       the one deciding test in China. 
                       <strong>So that's why I'm studying in uiuc</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Then what else??? I have no clue</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-4">
                    <h2>Major Things</h2>
                    <p>Almost everyone I met in college keeps telling me,
                       switching major to CS is almost impossible, even with a 4.0 GPA,
                       which I don't even have. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Hi</p>

                    <h3>Why Computer Science</h3>
                    <p>I didn't have any experience of coding or cs related in high school. 
                       Though I really wish I did, I mainly just stayed active in chemistry related
                       activities, that's probably why I was majoring in chem before. However, I always
                       have a dream or at least goal of coding, to build something myself so I decided 
                       to change my major in college. I know it's really really hard, not only courses themselves,
                       but also how the stress would often make me freak out. Me and my friends would often 
                       talk about this and it made my stress even worse. In the second semester, I decided
                       to talk about this less wiht my friends and focus more on activities I like. I 
                       took part in HackIllinois, which is probably the best decision I made so far. 
                       Even though I only did the UI, which is really similar to that one I made for CS125
                       final project, I really enjoy it. The whole coding environmenet was intimidating at
                       first but I eventually got used to it, <strong>and I love it!</strong>

                    <h3>Not Academic Related Stuff about Me</h3>
                    <p>I'm obssessed with working out and eating bread. Like literally getting the bread.
                       Though I'm 100% Chinese/Cantonese, I'm not into eating rice or noodles or whatever.
                       Bread is my LIFE! 
                       To keep on eating more and more bread and everything I like, I have to go workout.
                       I have to admit I'm not a pro at working out, and even really suck at it. 
                       But I can run! I've been on a running habit for over 5 years.
