            <h2>Volunteer and Service</h2>
            <img src="pics/paintcall.jpeg" style="height:300px;">
            <h6>Paint Call service during spring break 2019<br>
                At Krannart Center for Performing Arts</h6>
            <h5>It actually started when I was in 7th Grade, 7/27/2019</h5>
            <p>Volunteer has been a huge part of my life for years. I started doing service in 7th grade,
                middle school. It was a requirement for us, and I was reluctant as it was tiring. Going into
                high school, volunteering became much easier and I even led a team of students to do service
                in our local metro station every week. Then I had a little gap between high school and college, 
                I didn't do any services or join any organizations in the first semester. I was eager to find 
                the place that fits me. 
            </p><br>
            <p>Then I joined Alpha Phi Omega, which is a national service fraternity,
                and probably the best organization I've been in so far. 
                I didn't expect I would join a fraternity this fast, and it was
                all out of my expectation. I was referred by my friend and I went to
                its info session with my roommate to see how it actually looks like.
                I was surprised with how hyped people in it were and I was really comfortable with 
                talking to people in ice breaker, which is the thing we did for thousands of times 
                later in every event.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                APO is a huge time commitment for me. I thought I would handle things well,
                with a 18 credits schedule and attending kinds of events regularly. In fact,
                as it appears from my gpa in my resume, I did not. <strong>Everything stressed me out!</strong>
                Doing way too much service and attending required events just take a lot of time.
                It was until the end of the semester, when I was doing last two shifts of ETC coffee house,
                that I realized I really need to focus while doing such an easy service. 
                I would check everything as soon as I got there and see if there's anything
                I need to help with. Then I started working. I also chose night shifts instead of the busiest 
                Friday's. Though I know it was late to realize I should do service wisely, it was still
                a nice exerience. To be honost, I regret spending too much time on service. I mean 
                it's good to do service, but when it came to the point where it stresses me out so bad
                then that's a waste.Sigh.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                My experience in APO services are mostly about ETC Coffee House,
                others are HackIllinois, EOH, and Paint Call.
                Except ETC, I like HackILlinois most. Though I know it's probably the worst
                experience for some people, it's still good. Probably I actually participated in it
                and the shifts I assigned up for are those when my group members were not working.
                So that's like a back to back schedule. I worked with breakfast for two days. It
                was really fun for me to see how people were literally dying after pulling all nighters 
                for coding. Of course, breakfast was so good. Volunteers get free breakfast too!
